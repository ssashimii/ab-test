# A/B Test: New Onboarding vs Current

**Sample size:** 50 000 users (25 000 per group)  
**Primary metric:** Day 7 Retention

### Results  
- Control group (A): **30.13%**  
- Test group (B): **29.53%**  
- Absolute uplift: **–0.60 pp**  
- Relative uplift: **–1.99%**  
- Z-statistic: **1.47**  
- p-value: **0.143** (not significant at α = 0.05)

### Conclusion
The new onboarding version showed a small negative effect that is **not statistically significant**.  
The observed difference can be fully explained by random variation.

### Recommendation
**Do not roll out** the new onboarding.  
Continue using the current version (Group A).

### Next steps (optional)
- Stop testing the new onboarding
- If the team still likes the concept, analyze secondary metrics or prepare improved variant for next tests
